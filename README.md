# Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

Welcome to the **Guessing Game**! This is a simple Python program where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on each guess to help guide the player closer to the correct number. This project was a great introduction to Python programming, demonstrating basic concepts like user input, loops, and conditionals.

## How It Works
1. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
2. The player attempts to guess the number.
3. The program provides feedback:
   - **"WARM"**: Your guess is within 10 numbers of the target on the first attempt.
   - **"COLD"**: Your guess is not within 10 numbers of the target on the first attempt.
   - **"WARMER"**: Your guess is closer to the target than the previous guess.
   - **"COLDER"**: Your guess is farther away from the target than the previous guess.
4. The game ends when the player guesses the correct number, and the program displays the number of attempts.
